# Graph_Traversal
Find out all the connect components in the graph that contain the start nodes.

The graph used as input is generated by the SGA - String Graph Assembler.
SGA is a de novo genome assembler based on the concept of string graphs. The major goal of SGA is to be very memory efficient, which is achieved by using a compressed representation of DNA sequence reads.
link:  https://github.com/jts/sga#sga---string-graph-assembler

the python version is 3.6.5

# Preprocessing

the graph that generated by the SGA is saved in asqg format, which contains all the information of vertices and edges,and only the information about edges are needed. Filtering out all the unnecessary data is easy with the help of zgrep command in linux.

In a terminal of linux, run the fllowing command:

 1.  zgrep "ED.*" filename > output_filename
 2.  gzip output_filename


# Usage
search.py
----------------------------------------------------------
If you have enough memory to handle a huge graph, use search.py for better time-efficient,whole graph will be loaded into memory for further process. A graph that contains two million nodes need at 
least 13 GB memory.

Usage: 
search.py graph_file sam_file

positional arguments:
  graph_file  select the graph file
  sam_file    select the sam file as start node

Example: 
search.py example.gz example.sam

db_build.py and search_d.py
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. If you don't have enough memory, use db_build.py to build a database on your hard disk first.

Usage: db_build.py graph_file graph_database

positional arguments:
  graph_file      select the graph file
  graph_database  select the database of the graph

Example:
db_build.py  example.gz my_database.db 

2. After the database is built, use search_d.py to do the search.

Usage: search_d.py graph_database sam_file

positional arguments:
  graph_database  select the database of the graph
  sam_file        select the sam file as start node

Example:
search_d.py my_database.db example.sam
